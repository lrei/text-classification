This directory shows how the text classification tool was used to create the
predictions for the missing data in the Knowledge Graph.

Train and test data were exported from the KG.
The run_exp.sh scripts contains the commands used as well as an explanation.
The run_exp.sh script should be the starting point for understanding how to
replicate the experiment.

The directories and file names in the various .py and .sh scripts might need to
be adapted to replicate the results given a different path structure. Or
perhaps more easily, the structure should be replicated.
